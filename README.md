# STOR390project2

This is a project for a statistics class (STOR 390 w/ Giacomazzo). Our job is to predict games (binary W-L), spread, and total points for a handful of college football games over the last two weeks of the season. The webscraping Jupyter nb just gets team schedules from a few websites, and also grabs data from the sports-reference Python API. I convert this to csv files and build models in R to keep consistent with my other group members' work since we mostly use R here in the stats department at Carolina. We have high-dimensional data. A baseline logistic regression is barely better than random guessing for games win/loss(~56% accuracy). I did stepwise selection on win pct to narrow down the dimensions. I then built an xgboost model with an accuracy that converges around 76%. Still not great, but it's only the second model I've built.
